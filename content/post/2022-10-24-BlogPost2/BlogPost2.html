<p>We have decided to use the <strong>Abortion dataset</strong> gathered by the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
<p>Here are the initial steps that we will take to clean the data.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Remove overlaps in age column</p></li>
<li><p>Split the columns with age in it to create a column for age.</p></li>
<li><p>Make age as a factor.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify age data so that it is more easily interpretable (Added hyphen to separate the the upper and lower limits)</p></li>
<li><p>Input another dataset with relevant information regarding political affiliation for each state</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The main questions are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>How does the stateâ€™s party affiliation affect the abortion rates, births, miscarriages, etc?</p></li>
<li><p>How have age of pregnant mothers and abortion rates changed over the time?</p></li>
</ol>
