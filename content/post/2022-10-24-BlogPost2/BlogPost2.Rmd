We have decided to use the **Abortion dataset** gathered by the Guttmacher Institute. 

Here are the initial steps that we will take to clean the data. 

1. Remove overlaps in age column

2. Split the columns with age in it to create a column for age. 

3. Make age as a factor.

4. Modify age data so that it is more easily interpretable (Added hyphen to separate the the upper and lower limits)

5. Input another dataset with relevant information regarding political affiliation for each state

The main questions are: 

1. How does the stateâ€™s party affiliation affect the abortion rates, births, miscarriages, etc?

2. How have age of pregnant mothers and abortion rates changed over the time?
