## Equitable Data

The equity principles most relevant to our data set are beneficence and respect for persons. On the principle of beneficence, we are aware of how sensitive the topic can be, potential risks of re-identification, transparency, and how publication could be misconstrued against people and communities. Firstly, we acknowledge that the topic of abortion/pregnancy/miscarrages can be a very sensitive one to the general public, as well as a highly politicized topic given the recent upheaval following the Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade. Therefore, any interpretation of this topic could potentially harm communities so we must present our findings carefully and thoughtfully, as we do not want our findings to be misinterpreted in a harmful way. Secondly, data about abortions and miscarrages has potential to unintentionally expose sensitive information about individuals that could be harmful to them. Luckily, our specific data set does not contain any personally identifiable information, with the information only going as far as statewide and age being in ranges. Finally, there are some clear limitations we have on what we can do because of the data set that we chose.  As stated before, our data set deals with statewide data with age ranges instead of every year, so we are missing a lot of information that could give us more insight onto the data. Our analysis is limited because we do not have information like demographics, context surrounding each pregnancy/abortion, health of the mother, and socio-economic status. 


On the principle of respect for persons we understand the  importance of informed consent and transparency on what the plans are for the data after the conclusion of our project. Because of the sensitivity of our topic, we believe that informed consent is essential because the data does include teenagers who deserve special consideration and protection. It is important that they understand the purpose of the information collected about them and how that information is intended to be used. We also want to acknowledge that future data analysis should use datasets that explicitly include marginalized groups - our transparency about this significant limitation is critical. Our intention with this project is to share information with community members in a clear and digestible way with our intentions being transparent.
