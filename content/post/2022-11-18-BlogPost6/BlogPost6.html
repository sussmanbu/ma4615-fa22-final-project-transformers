<p>#Blog Post 6
This blog post is to describe our thoughts and progress on the interactive. We hope to use this to see the big picture trends and to “zoom in” on subsets or individual data points.</p>
<p>We will be using Shiny to develop our interactive. We would like to have the user first input their personal information (state or political affiliation), so that they can “zoom in” to the relevant data points to them. Then we can build on the combined dataset/plot from Blog Post 5 (see below). However, we would like to add year (and maybe age) to this visual, so users can observe the chronological and age-related trend that is most relevant to them.</p>
<p>We also are considering making a predicted model about the political affiliation and the abortion rate in a specific state. So when the user changes to one political affiliation to another, the user can know the result of the abortion rate if the other party takes over. For example, Democrats taking over NY state which has the highest abortion rate, so when the user change to Republicans (assume the NY is taking over by republicans) of the NY, the graph shows the result of the changed abortion rate.</p>
