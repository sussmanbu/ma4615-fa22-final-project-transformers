# Pregnancy and Abortion Rates: Trends Over Time

## Abortion Rate is Impacted by Political Affiliation
* Based on the limited exploratory data analysis that we have conducted, it seems that pregnancy rate is not impacted by political affiliation, but abortion rate is. This is supported by the graphs 1 and 2 on our analysis page that show Average Pregnancy and Abortion Rate by State Affiliation. On the Abortion rate graph, there is a clear pattern where Democratic states have higher abortion rates as compared to Republican states. However, on the Pregnancy rate graph, this distinction is not as apparent.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(AverageAbortionRate = mean(AbortionRate, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  inner_join(MaxStateAff) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  stat_summary(aes(x = reorder(state, AverageAbortionRate), y = AverageAbortionRate, fill = as.factor(Affiliation)), geom = "bar") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#00214d', '#7c7b78', '#e91515')) + 
  labs(title = 'Average Abortion Rate by State Affiliation', x = 'State\n', y = '\nAverage Abortion Rate', fill = "Affliation") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7), axis.title = element_text(size = 10), legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% blo
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(AveragePregnancyRate = mean(PregnancyRate, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  inner_join(MaxStateAff) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  stat_summary(aes(x = reorder(state, AveragePregnancyRate), y = AveragePregnancyRate, fill = as.factor(Affiliation)), geom = "bar") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#00214d', '#7c7b78', '#e91515')) + 
  labs(title = 'Average Pregnancy Rate by State Affiliation', x = 'State\n', y = '\nAverage Pregnancy Rate', fill = "Affliation") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7), axis.title = element_text(size = 10), legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8))
```

## Over the Years, Less Teenage Pregnancy. More Waiting Til the 30s 
* Over the last 30 years, it seems that the pregnancy rate for age groups 15-24 has significantly decreased, while the pregnancy rate for age groups 30-39 have increased. That is, childbearers seems to be getting pregnant later in life in recent years, as compared to teenagers.

### Is this why there are fewer abortions for Teens?
* For the abortion rate graph, we noticed an overall increase in abortions between years 1970-1980. This aligns with the legalization of abortion (the Supreme Court ruling of Roe v. Wade) in the US in 1973. After 1990, we notice a decrease in abortion rate for age groups 15-24. 
* Or could it be other driving factors? Is it the political climate?

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AveragePregRate = mean(PregnancyRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = AveragePregRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = 'Average Pregnancy Rate by Age Group from 1973 to 2017', x = 'Year', y = 'Average Pregnancy Rate', color = "Age Group") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "turbo")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AverageAbortionRate = mean(AbortionRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = AverageAbortionRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = 'Average Abortion Rate by Age Group from 1973 to 2017', x = 'Year', y = 'Average Abortion Rate', color = "Age Group") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "turbo")
```

## Putting it All Together
### Pregnancy Rate Not Impacted by Political Affilation Across All Age Groups
* When we integrated the impact of our 2 variables of interest, we noticed that there was no significant difference in pregnancy rate over the years by political affiliation for any age group.

### Abortion Rate IS Impacted for Childbearers Aged 18-34 in Republican States
* However, when we did the same for abortion rate, there was a clear difference. That is, we noticed that the abortion rate of 15-17 year olds and people older that 35 are similar between the two political affiliations, but for the ages groups between those, 18-34 years old, have much higher average abortion rates in Democratic states than Republican states.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(state, year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AveragePregRate = mean(PregnancyRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  inner_join(MaxStateAff) %>% 
  filter(Affiliation %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = AveragePregRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ as.factor(Affiliation)) +
  labs(title = 'Average Pregnancy Rate by Age Group for Different Political Affiliations', x = 'Year', y = 'Average Pregnancy Rate', color = "Age Group")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(state, year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AverageAbortionRate = mean(AbortionRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  inner_join(MaxStateAff) %>% 
  filter(Affiliation %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = AverageAbortionRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ as.factor(Affiliation)) +
  labs(title = 'Average Abortion Rate by Age Group for Different Political Affiliations', x = 'Year', y = 'Average Abortion Rate', color = "Age Group")
```

## In Summary 
* Age of childbearer and time seem to impact pregnancy, but political affiliation may not.
* Over time, fewer teenagers are getting pregnant: instead it seems like people are waiting until their 30s.  
* Political affiliation, age of childbearer, and time all seem to impact abortion rates. 
* Abortion rates peaked after 1973 after the ruling of Roe v Wade. They decreased after 1990 for teens and young adults. When broken down by political affiliation, ages groups 18-34 have much higher average abortion rates in Democratic states than Republican states.

## Other Factors to Consider
* Birth control: this analysis did not include prevalence of birth control usage over time, age group, or location. We imagine that this information would influence both pregnancy rates, and therefore abortion rates. Future analysis should include this information to tell the full story. 
* Births and Miscarriages: To simplify our interpretation due to the time constraints of this project, we did not visualize the variables of births and miscarriages. If we had more time, our next steps would be to include these variables. We know that the decision to have an abortion may be multifaceted, and it is not uncommon for childbearers to require abortions due to birth complications and even miscarriages.
* Socio-economic status and demographics: Our data did not include this information, but we know that these factors can significantly impact access to healthcare (aka, birth control, education surrounding safe sex, and care during pregnancy). Future research should include these variables to better serve the full public.
* Today's Political Climate: On June 24, 2022, Roe v. Wade was overturned. Unfortunately, our data were only collected until 2017. Given the recent changes in federal law, we know that state-specific laws have played a larger role in pregnancy and abortion-related decisions. Our story is not complete: given the initial spike in abortion rate that aligned with the historic ruling in 1973, we imagine that there would be some significant change and perhaps interaction between our variables of interest as a result of the recent policy changes.
