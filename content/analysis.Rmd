# Data Analysis 

* Because Roe v. Wade is a highly politicized issue that has gained media attention that has varied over the years, we wanted to analyze pregnancy and abortion rates in the context of political affiliation and chronological year. In addition to political affiliation and changes over time, we are also interested in how these changing factors influence pregnancy and abortion rates by year. 
* We are interested in investigating the degree to which pregnancy and abortion rates have changed over time and how these trends have changed depending on age group of the mother within the context of political affiliation. 
* Our main questions that we hope to answer with our analysis and data modeling are: How does state's party affiliation affect abortion rates, births, and miscarriages? How have the age of pregnant mothers and abortion rates changed over time?

## Initial Analysis

### Graph 1: Average Abortion Rate By State Affiliation

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(AverageAbortionRate = mean(AbortionRate, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  inner_join(MaxStateAff) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  stat_summary(aes(x = reorder(state, AverageAbortionRate), y = AverageAbortionRate, fill = as.factor(Affiliation)), geom = "bar") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "cividis") + 
  labs(title = 'Average Abortion Rate by State Affiliation', x = 'State\n', y = '\nAverage Abortion Rate', fill = "Affliation") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7), axis.title = element_text(size = 10), legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8))
```

* We began our analysis by graphing the average abortion rate of each state as a horizontal bar graph with each bar color coded by state affiliation(Democrats, Republicans, or Divided).

* From our plot, we saw some noticeable trends. The states with the highest average abortion rates were almost entirely Democratically affiliated. The states with the lowest average abortion rates were almost entirely Republican affiliated. Some exceptions to these trends are Nevada and Florida, which are states with high abortion rate but are not fully Democratically affiliated. More exceptions to the trend of low abortion rate states being fully Republican affiliated are Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Maine, and Ohio. Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ohio are divided states who have low abortion rates, while Iowa and Maine are Democratic Affiliated states with low abortion rates.

### Graph 2: Average Pregnancy Rate By State Affiliation

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(AveragePregnancyRate = mean(PregnancyRate, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  inner_join(MaxStateAff) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  stat_summary(aes(x = reorder(state, AveragePregnancyRate), y = AveragePregnancyRate, fill = as.factor(Affiliation)), geom = "bar") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "cividis") + 
  labs(title = 'Average Pregnancy Rate by State Affiliation', x = 'State\n', y = '\nAverage Pregnancy Rate', fill = "Affliation") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7), axis.title = element_text(size = 10), legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8))
```

* Next, we decided to look at average pregnancy rate by state affiliation in order to see if there were also any noticeable trends. It was actually surprising to see how the graph was spread out. 

* The states with the highest average pregnancy rate are Nevada, New Jersey, California, Hawaii, New York, and Alaska. All of these states except for Nevada, a divided state, and Alaska, a Republican affiliated state, are Democratically affiliated. The states with the lowest average pregnancy rate are Maine, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. All of these states except for West Virginia, a Republican affiliated state, and Wisconsin, a divided state, are Democratically affiliated. A majority of the Republican affiliated states are centralized on this graph, meaning they stand in the middle, with a few Democratically affiliated states and divided states sprinkled between them.

### Graph 3: Average Pregnancy Rate by Age group 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AveragePregRate = mean(PregnancyRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = AveragePregRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = 'Average Pregnancy Rate by Age Group from 1973 to 2017', x = 'Year', y = 'Average Pregnancy Rate', color = "Age Group") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "turbo")
```

* Next, we wanted to see the average pregnancy rate for different age groups over the last 50 years. 

* From our graph, we can see each age group as its own line that we can look at individually or all together. If we look at the plot as a whole, we can see that there was a shift in almost every adjacent line crosses each other around the years 1995 to 2002. Prior to 2002, 20-24 year olds had a higher average pregnancy rate than 25-29 year olds, but after 2002, 25-29 year olds started having a higher average pregnancy rate than 20-24 year olds. Prior to 2002, 18-19 year olds had a higher average pregnancy rate than 30-34 year olds, but after 2002, 30-34 year olds started having a higher average pregnancy rate than 18-19 year olds. Prior to 1998, 15-17 year olds had a higher average pregnancy rate than 35-39 year olds, but after 1998, 35-39 year olds started having a higher average pregnancy rate than 15-17 year olds. Lastly, prior to 1996, <15 year olds had a higher average pregnancy rate than 40> year olds, but after 1996, 40> year olds started having a higher average pregnancy rate than <15 year olds.

* Now we looked at each line individually. The average pregnancy rate of 20-24 year olds, 18-19 year olds, 15-17 year olds, <15 year olds has been decreasing ever since 1990. The average pregnancy rates of 30-34 year olds, 35-39 year olds, and 40> year olds has been increasing since around 1990. The average pregnancy rate of 25-29 year olds has been fluctuating since 1973. 

* In 1973, the order of highest to lowest pregnancy by age group was 20-24 year olds, 25-29 year olds, 28-19 year olds, 30-34 year olds, 15-17 year olds, 35-39 year olds, <15 year olds, then 40> year olds. In 2017, the order of highest to lowest pregnancy rate became 25-29 year olds, 30-34 year olds, 20-24 year olds, 35-39 year olds, 18-19 year olds, 40> year olds, 15-17 year olds, then <15 year olds. From this trend we can say that as years have gone by on average, less teenagers have been getting pregnant and more adult women have been getting pregnant. 

### Graph 4: Average Abortion Rate by Age group 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AverageAbortionRate = mean(AbortionRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = AverageAbortionRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = 'Average Abortion Rate by Age Group from 1973 to 2017', x = 'Year', y = 'Average Abortion Rate', color = "Age Group") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "turbo")
```

* Next, we wanted to see the average abortion rate for different age groups over the last 50 years.

* Looking at the graph as a whole, it is clear to see that in general, the average abortion rate of all age groups is lower now than it was in 1973. Similarly to the previous graph, almost every adjacent age group lines cross each other at some point, except for the lines of age groups 30-34 year olds and 35-39 year olds which do not cross at any point. Prior to 1991, 18-19 year olds had a higher average abortion rate than 20-24 year olds, then after 1991, 20-24 year olds started having a higher abortion rate than 18-19 year olds. From 1973-1988, the average abortion rate of 25-29 year old and 15-17 year olds cross each other continuously, then after 1988 the lines diverge where the average abortion rate of 25-29 becomes much higher than the average abortion rate of 15-17 year olds. Prior to 2005, the average abortion rate of <15 year olds is higher than the average abortion rate of 40> year olds, then after 2005 the lines overlap for a few years before diverging to 40> year olds having a higher average abortion rate than <15 year olds. 

* Now looking at the lines individually, we can see that the average abortion rate of 18-19 year olds, 20-24 year olds, 15-17 year old, and <15 year olds has been in a general decline since around 1988. The average abortion rate of 25-29 year olds, 30-34 year olds, 35-39 year olds, and 40> year olds has stayed fairly consistent for the last 50 years. With these trends we can say that on average young women and teenagers have been getting less abortions since 1988, while women over the age if 25 have not really changed the frequency of abortions.

### Graph 5: Average Pregnancy Rate by Age group for Different Political Affiliations

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(state, year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AveragePregRate = mean(PregnancyRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  inner_join(MaxStateAff) %>% 
  filter(Affiliation %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = AveragePregRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ as.factor(Affiliation)) +
  labs(title = 'Average Pregnancy Rate by Age Group for Different Political Affiliations', x = 'Year', y = 'Average Pregnancy Rate', color = "Age Group")
```

* Next, we wanted to see if political affiliation of state had any affect on average pregnancy rate by age group.

* On general, it looks like the average pregnancy rate by age group seem the same for Democrat affiliated states and Republican affiliated states. However, if we look closer, there are some subtle differences between the two. 

* In 2017, for Democrat affiliated states, the average pregnancy rate of 25-29 year olds and 30-34 year olds overlap each other as the age group with the highest average abortion rate, while for Republican affiliated states, the average pregnancy rate of 25-29 year olds is higher than 30-34 year olds. Another difference is that in 2017, the average abortion rate for 35-39 year olds in Democrat affiliated states is higher than 18-19 year olds, while the opposite is true in Republican affiliated states. In 2017, the average pregnancy rate of 40> year olds is higher than 15-17 year olds in Democrat affiliated states, while these two group overlap in Republican affiliated states.

### Graph 6: Average Abortion Rate by Age group for Different Political Affiliations

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(state, year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AverageAbortionRate = mean(AbortionRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  inner_join(MaxStateAff) %>% 
  filter(Affiliation %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = AverageAbortionRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ as.factor(Affiliation)) +
  labs(title = 'Average Abortion Rate by Age Group for Different Political Affiliations', x = 'Year', y = 'Average Abortion Rate', color = "Age Group")
```

* Next, we wanted to see if political affiliation of state had any affect on average abortion rate by age group.

* Unlike the previous graph, the is a clear visual difference between average abortion rate in Democrat affiliated states and Republican affiliated states. In general, it seems that the overall abortion rate is higher in Democrat affiliated states than in Republican affiliated states. Within each state affiliation, the order from highest to lowest average abortion rate is generally the same. Some small differences are that the average abortion rate of 20-24 year olds in Republican affiliated states have a slightly higher than 25-29 year olds, while in Democrat affiliated states they two age groups overlap, and the average abortion rate of <15 year olds is slightly lower than 40> year olds in Democrat affiliated states, while in Republican affiliated states the two age groups overlap.

## Modeling

### Graph 7: Average Pregnancy Rate of Teenagers over the last 50 years

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

teenPregData <- 
  abortionDataClean %>% 
  group_by(year, Age) %>% 
  summarise(AveragePregRate = mean(`PregnancyRate`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(Age %in% c("<15", "15-17", "18-19")) 

teenPregMod <- 
  lm(AveragePregRate ~ year, data = teenPregData)

beta <- 
  coef(teenPregMod)

teenPregData <- 
  teenPregData %>% 
  add_predictions(teenPregMod)

teenPregData %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = AveragePregRate, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), data = teenPregData, color = "red", size = 1) + 
  labs(title = 'Average Pregnancy Rate of Teenagers from 1973 to 2017', x = '\nYear', y = 'Average Pregnancy Rate\n', color = "Age Group") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8)) + 
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma")
```

* We wanted to see the trend of teen pregnancy, so we created a model which predicts the Average Pregnancy Rate among teenagers. One limitation of this model is that it does not include any information on abortion or political affiliation. However, paired with our other visualizations, this linear model provides foundational information regarding the potential relationships between teen pregnancies, abortion, and abortion laws. Importantly, the trend line helps us to visualize what we might see in years to come.

### Graph 8: Residuals for Teen Pregnancy Model

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
teenPregData %>% 
  add_residuals(teenPregMod) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, resid)) + 
  geom_ref_line(h=0) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  labs(title = 'Residuals for Teen Pregnancy Model', x = '\nYear', y = 'Residual\n', color = "Age Group") + 
  ggthemes::theme_economist() +
  theme(legend.position = 'right', legend.text = element_text(size = 8)) + 
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma")
```

* This supplementary graph shows us how well our model is predicting Average Teen Pregnancy Rates.

state_abortion_rate <- 
  state_abortion_rate[!duplicated(state_abortion_rate$state), ]
```

```{r join overall abortion rate dataset with state, geographic location and political affiliation dataset, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE,}
state_data <- 
  inner_join(states_geog_aff, state_abortion_rate, by = c("STUSPS" = "state")) %>%

  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE, legend.title.size = 2, legend.text.size = 1.5)
```

* We wanted to provide a visual representation of political affiliation of each state by color, red for Republican affiliated, blue for Democrat affiliated, and gray for divided states. Anyone can hover over a state, which will tell you the name of the state, then clicking on a state will tell you the affiliation of the state.

### Map 2: Overall Abortion Rate by Region

```{r load region data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
us_regions <- 
  us_regions %>% 
  st_transform(epsg_us)
```

```{r get overall abortion data by region, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
region_abortion_rate <- 
  inner_join(states_geog_aff, abortionDataClean, by = c("STUSPS" = "state")) %>% 
  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>% 
  group_by(GeographicRegion) %>% 
  select(GeographicRegion, Abortions, Population) %>% 
  mutate(GeographicRegion, total_population = sum(Population), total_abortions = sum(Abortions), overall_abortion_rate = total_abortions/total_population) %>% 
  select(GeographicRegion, total_abortions, total_population, overall_abortion_rate) %>% 
  st_drop_geometry()

region_abortion_rate <- 
  region_abortion_rate[!duplicated(region_abortion_rate$GeographicRegion), ]

region_abortion_rate <- 
  region_abortion_rate[!duplicated(region_abortion_rate$GeographicRegion), ]

region_abortion_rate <- 
  st_set_geometry(region_abortion_rate, us_regions$geometry)
```

```{r plot map by geographic location, fig.width=80, fig.height=80, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
region_data <- 
  region_abortion_rate %>% 
   select(GeographicRegion, overall_abortion_rate, geometry)

tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(region_data) +

  tm_shape(state_data) + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE, legend.title.size = 2, legend.text.size = 1.5)
```

* This second visual that we wanted to create shows overall abortion rate by region. Each state is color coded by overall abortion rate, yellow for 0.010 to 0.015, light orange for 0.015 to 0.020, orange for 0.020 to 0.025, and red for 0.025 to 0.030. When you hover over a state, you will see the region that the state lies in. When you click onto a state, it will tell you the precise overall abortion rate of that state.
