## Data Analysis 

* Because Roe v. Wade is a highly politicized issue that has gained media attention that has varied over the years, we wanted to analyze pregnancy and abortion rates in the context of political affiliation and chronological year. In addition to political affiliation and changes over time, we are also interested in how these changing factors influence pregnancy and abortion rates by year. 
* We are interested in investigating the degree to which pregnancy and abortion rates have changed over time and how these trends have changed depending on age group of the mother within the context of political affiliation. 
* Our main questions that we hope to answer with our analysis and data modeling are: How does state's party affiliation affect abortion rates, births, and miscarriages? How have the age of pregnant mothers and abortion rates changed over time?

## Graph 1: Average Abortion Rate By State Affiliation

* We began our analysis by graphing the average abortion rate of each state as a horizontal bar graph with each bar color coded by state affiliation(Democrats, Republicans, or Divided).

* From our plot, we saw some noticeable trends. The states with the highest average abortion rates were almost entirely Democratically affiliated. The states with the lowest average abortion rates were almost entirely Republican affiliated.

## Graph 2: Average Pregnancy Rate by Age group 

Next, we wanted to see the average pregnancy rate for different age groups over the last 50 years. 

From our graph, we can see each age group as its own line that we can look at individually or all together.

## Modeling


* Breadth of the DA
  * Make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.
  * i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?
* Depth of the DA
  * When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well. 
  * The depth of the DA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.
* Modeling and Inference 
  * You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.
  * Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
  * Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
* Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
  * Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? ...
* Clarity Figures
  * Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
  * Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.
* Clarity of Explanations
  * Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?
  * How well do you explain each figure/result?
  * Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
* Organization and cleanliness.
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
